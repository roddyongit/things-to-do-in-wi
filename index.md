## Concept of the project

 Welcome to Wisconsin! We are so exited to have you here!

 We are glad to present to you our new web application:
 "Things to do in Wisconsin"

This is a website to present some of the many cool things
that residents and visitors could do in the state of Wisconsin.
The website was designed to be very friendly and easy to use
by anyone.

 See a few things you can do with this application:
 
  1. Search things to do in Wisconsin by category and city
  2. Download the results of your search to your computer
  3. View a photo gallery of Wisconsin
  4. Learn how to use it from the documentation page
 
We hope you enjoy using this new web application!
